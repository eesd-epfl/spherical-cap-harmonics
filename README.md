"Spherical Cap Harmonic Analysis (SCHA) for Characterising the Morphology of Rough Surface Patches"
By: Mahmoud Shaqfa, Gary P. T. Choi, Katrin Beyer

See the article (open access): https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032591021006720

The Matlab codes include implementations for:
- Spherical Cap Harmonics (SCH)
- Spherical Harmonics (SH)
- Hemispherical Harmonics (HSH)

These codes deal with morphological reconstruction of convex and nonconvex open and closed surfaces. This paper is focusing mainly on dealing with rough surfaces but it also can be used for different applications such as medical imaging.

A video render of the reconstruction process for the geometry in Fig. 9 of the abovementioned paper can be found here:
