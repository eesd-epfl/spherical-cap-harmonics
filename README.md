This release is part of the paper:
"Spherical Cap Harmonic Analysis (SCHA) for Characterising the Morphology of Rough Surface Patches"
By: Mahmoud Shaqfa, Gary P. T. Choi, Katrin Beyer (Submitted for publication)

The Matlab codes include implementations for:
- Spherical Cap Harmonics (SCH)
- Spherical Harmonics (SH)
- Hemispherical Harmonics (HSH)

These codes to deal with morphological reconstruction of convex and nonconvex open and closed surfaces.
